# Final project for the course Cloud Computing

We built a Web-App using AWS technologies. The aim of the Web-App is to classify bird species from their sound. The user can upload its sound on a static and serverless Web-App, which exploits AWS technologies to process (Lambda) and classify (SageMaker) it. The web site is available [HERE](http://bird-sound-app.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com).
The Web-App is hosted on a public S3 bucket. The interaction between the Web-App and the back-end is made possible by the API Gateway, through which is possible to call the main Lambda. Then it sends a request to SageMaker that returns as response the bird to which corresponds that sound with the highest probability.

* **lambda_functions** contains the codes used to implement the two lambda functions and the tests used.
* **lambda_layer_ffmpeg** is the layer that was installed on one lambda function.
* **sage_maker** contains all the code used for the model training and deployment.
* **aws_scaling.txt** is an example of the logs of the scaling policy generated by AWS.
* **example.mp3** is an example of audio.
* **testing-report.json** is the testing report generated by Artillery.io.
